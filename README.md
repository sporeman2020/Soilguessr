A Website &amp; Game Preview Demo

## Project Statement
The goal of this site is to make a Geoguessr website clone that includes all the elements capable of playing a fake version of geoguessr where you get put into a random location and are required to guess the position when the only info given is of an angle of the side of the road without context in the distance.
